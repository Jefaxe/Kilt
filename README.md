## Kilt

- A Python Libary / High-end API for interacting with the Modrinth API ([labrinth](https://github.com/modrinth/labrinth))

# Instaltion  
Run:  
`git clone https://github.com/Jefaxe/Kilt.git`  
`cd Kilt`  
`pip install .` or `python setup.py install`

# Usage

See the WIP [wiki](https://github.com/Jefaxe/Kilt/wiki)

Basically, you can search [modrinrth](https://modrinth.com) using kilt.labrinth.search,
and there are other things you can do with it that are similiar. It may expand to working with CurseForge, which doesn't really have an API so it'll be very hacky.
