        # FAQ
        Q: Why am I getting `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'name'`    
        A: `labrinth.get` (or `labrinth.search`) returns a **list** of Mod objects. Not a single one. So to access the first element, just put `[0]` at the end of you call to `labrinth.get` or `labrinth.search` (aliases)
        
        Q: Why do some attempts at `{Mod object}.download` raise `error.NoVersionFound`?   
        A: Modrinth allows a mod to be uploaded without a version, so trying to download *would* raise an `IndexError`, and not have the desired result, so I decided to have my own error for it.
        
        
        # Changelog
        See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Jefaxe/Kilt/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md)
        Note that versions with the tag "w" are very messed up, and are only kept because I don't want to delete versions. Never use these, ever. They don't work
        
        
        # Modules
        Kilt is split into modules. They are `error` (for custom exceptions), `__init__` (needed),
        `config` (for [runtime config](https://github.com/Jefaxe/Kilt/wiki/Runtime-Configuration)),
        `version` (for data about the package version), `labrinth` (the main part)

        # Versioning
        The package/project uses [semver](https://semver.org) 2.0.0. 
        The package distribution uses [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) (Only because it is a literal requirement, it should use SemVer )
        
        
        **{MAJOR}.{feature update}.{bugfix}-{dev-stage}.{stage-update}+build.{DD.MM.YYYY}**
        
        >*MAJOR: Will be 0 unless there is a backwards-incompatible change that occurs in a stable branch.*
        
        >*feature update: it adds features*
        
        >*bugfix: A bugfix for a version, may be made after the next {feature update} has started development, but will loose support when {feature update} hits stable branch.*
        
        >*dev-stage:   
        Alpha: only available in source, and may break at any time, or be broken.  
        Beta: May be skipped, or just have one beta. More stable than Alpha, and/or closer to release.   
        Release Candidate: meant to be the full release, but I remember to add something else. Last RC will be the same (except version data) as full release.*
        
        >*stage-update: The number of releases in the current {dev-stage}*
        
        >*DD.MM.YYYY: The date the build was published to pypi.org, or its platform for its {dev-stage}*
        
        Note that the package in build/lib/kilt/  is a copy of the latest build that has been uploaded to test.pypi.org or pypi.org, and an exact copy of that is in dist/kilt-{release}.tar.gz > kilt/
